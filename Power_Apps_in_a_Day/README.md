# Power App in a Day


## Hands-on-Labs

[Hands-on-Labs Introduction slides](./AppInADay%20Lab%20Introduction.pptx)

**Business scenario**
- Imagine an organization where every three years employees go through a hardware refresh cycle
- We will streamline the device order, procurement and approval process and view aggregate reports
- The employee-facing device ordering app needs to run in a web browser and on mobile devices

**Lab objectives**
- Build a Power Apps Canvas App for employee facing device ordering experience
- Use Dataverse to store the device orders in the cloud
- Build a Power Apps Model-driven app to complete the procurement process
- Use Power Automate to build an approval workflow for device approval


**Note:** Microsoft Cloud services are dynamic, so the User Interface (UI) can be change.
